# Mod One Project: a Tic Tac Toe game

I built a simple Tic Tac Toe game in javascript / jQuery / HTML / CSS that can be played in the browser with either two people, or one person vs. a computer.

Please visit to play: https://github.com/andrewcancode/tictactoe.git

## MVP - Minimum Viable Product

Your game must meet these requirements:

Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery (this game will be played using the DOM, not the console)
Hosted on github pages
Commits to github every day
A README.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, a link to your live site, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

Game must have:

Must be a two player game (either against the computer or against another player)
    Example: Blackjack: A player plays against the dealer. The dealer is the computer
    Example: Connect Four: Two players pass the game between themselves to take turns
A win state - a way for the player to win the game
    High score can be considered a win state

A lose state - a way for the player to lose the game
    Example: Blackjack - a player must be able to lose all of their money with losing hands and cannot play if their bankroll is at 0
    Example: Connect Four - the other player has won or there are no possible plays left

A way to keep playing if the game is not over

Multiple rounds to play - a round must begin, end, and there must be a way to check if the game should continue or the overall game is won or lost
    Example: Blackjack: a player takes turns playing a hand versus a computer - the player's hand can either win, lose or tie the dealer. If the player has enough money in their bankroll they can keep playing. A player must be able to win several rounds and increase their bankroll
    Example: Connect Four: two (non-computer) players take turns adding chips to the board. The game will check if a player won or if the board is full and there are no more plays possible. A player gets four chips in a row (vertically or horizontally)- one person wins, one loses, there are no further plays in this case 

## Stretch Goals (Not Mandatory):
Recommended Features

A way to reset the board and play again 
CSS to give your game a personal and fun style 
Responsive mobile design 
Work with your instructor to determine additional stretch goals

## Post MVP - to improve

Improve computer algorithm - maybe add option to choose difficulty?
